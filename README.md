## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to use media queries in CSS to style a webpage according to the size of the display screen.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 375px) and (max-width: 375px) {
    .container {
      width:250px;
    }

    h2{
        font-size:1.3em;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to persue my researches and learning about media queries. I find it really important that a webpage is designed in such a way that it is viewable both on desktop devices and mobile phones. The use of media queries allows us to scale a webpage accordingly to make the webpage scalableon any devices we want.

For further learning, i would like to start using keyframes to include animation in my project. The use of animation makes a webpage much more user friendly to end-users which will be more keen to use the website. I would also like to start learning javascript to make a website smoother and more user-friendly as well.
